## Introduction

A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure where each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. These nodes can store data and are organized in such a way that it allows for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion of data.

This C project provides a basic implementation of binary trees, including the creation of nodes, insertion of data, and simple traversal operations.

## Features

- Create a binary tree node.
- Insert new elements into the tree.
- Perform in-order, pre-order, and post-order traversals of the tree.
- Clean up and release memory used by the tree.

## Requirements

To compile and run this project, you will need:

- A C compiler (e.g., GCC)
- Basic knowledge of the C programming languag
